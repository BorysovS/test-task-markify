## Usage

Using Live Server This project is designed to be run using the Live Server extension in Visual
Studio Code (VS Code). Follow these steps to set it up:

Install Live Server Extension:

Open VS Code. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Sidebar or by
pressing Ctrl+Shift+X. Search for Live Server by Ritwick Dey and install it. Open the Project
Folder:

Open the project folder in VS Code by selecting File > Open Folder and navigating to your project
directory. Start Live Server:

Open the index.html file in VS Code. Right-click on the index.html file and select Open with Live
Server. Your default browser should open and display the web page. If not, you can manually open
your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5500. Without Live Server If you prefer not to use
Live Server, you can simply open the index.html file directly in your browser. However, note that
some features might not work as expected without a local server.
